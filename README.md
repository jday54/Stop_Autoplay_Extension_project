Extension to stop Youtube autoplay, specifically for your Watch Later list.

- Since Youtube doesn't let the user disable autoplay for the Watch Later playlist, this extension will automatically prevent the autoplaying of the next video in your Watch Later playlist.

*Note: 
- currently only works for Watch Later list
- currently only works if the selected video is opened in a new tab
- *Used to be available on Chrome Web Store as an installable extension. I don't have time to make it compatible with newer versions of Chrome, so for now the code is available here
